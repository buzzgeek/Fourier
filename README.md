# Fourier
Various implementations related to Fourier series and transformations - playground to learn concepts

- Visualization fourier series
- Visualization discrete fourier transform with 2 epicycles
- Visualization discrete fourier transform with 1 epicycle
- ...

The cpp project utilizes imgui and implot. The project has been build with MS Visual Studio v17.1.1. It is very likely that the code can be ported to unix base systems, with 'low' effort
