# Fourier
Various implementations related to Fourier series and transformations - playground to learn concepts

- Visualization fourier series
- Visualiyation fourier transform
- ...

The cpp project utilizes imgui and implot. The project has been build with MS Visual Studio v17.1.1. It is very likely that the code can be ported to unix base systems, with 'low' effort
